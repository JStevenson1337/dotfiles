# Backup and Encryption Script

## Overview

This script performs system updates, backs up configuration files and directories, creates symbolic links, searches for `.org` files, and encrypts the backup files using GPG.

## Features

1. **System Update**:
   - Updates and upgrades packages on a Debian-based system.
   - Cleans up unnecessary packages.

2. **RC Files Backup and Symlink**:
   - Moves common RC files to a backup directory and creates symbolic links to the original locations.

3. **Configuration Directories and Files Backup and Symlink**:
   - Moves specified configuration directories and additional files to a backup directory and creates symbolic links.

4. **Search and Move `.org` Files**:
   - Recursively searches for `.org` files in the `$HOME/Projects` directory and moves them to a specified backup directory.

5. **Encryption**:
   - Compresses the backup directories into `.tar.gz` files.
   - Encrypts the compressed files using a GPG key.
   - Cleans up the unencrypted compressed files.

## Usage

1. **Save the Script**:
   Save the script to a file (e.g., `backup_and_symlink.sh`).

2. **Set Permissions**:
   Give it execute permissions with:
   ```bash
   chmod +x backup_and_symlink.sh


./backup_and_symlink.sh /path/to/packages_file

Replace /path/to/packages_file with the path to a file containing package names or commands for the grep operation.

sudo bash -c 'for i in update {,dist-}upgrade auto{remove,clean}; do apt-get $i -y; done'

RC Files Backup and Symlink
Moves common RC files to $HOME/.runconf.
Creates symbolic links from the original locations to the new backup location.
Configuration Directories and Files Backup and Symlink
Moves specified directories and files to $HOME/confdirs.
Creates symbolic links from the original locations to the new backup location.
Search and Move .org Files

find "$HOME/Projects" -type f -name "*.org" -exec mv {} "$org_files_backup" \;

Encryption
GPG Key: DCC2C3D389236A2485CC515339328501C8FF50EB
Compresses and encrypts backup directories:


tar -czf "$runconf_dir.tar.gz" -C "$HOME" "$(basename "$runconf_dir")"
tar -czf "$conf_dirs_backup.tar.gz" -C "$HOME" "$(basename "$conf_dirs_backup")"
tar -czf "$org_files_backup.tar.gz" -C "$HOME/Projects/Code" "$(basename "$org_files_backup")"
gpg --encrypt --recipient "$gpg_recipient" "$runconf_dir.tar.gz"
gpg --encrypt --recipient "$gpg_recipient" "$conf_dirs_backup.tar.gz"
gpg --encrypt --recipient "$gpg_recipient" "$org_files_backup.tar.gz"

Notes
Ensure that the GPG key with the specified ID is available in your GPG keyring.
Adjust paths and filenames in the script as needed for your environment.
Troubleshooting
File Not Found: Ensure that all paths and files exist before running the script.
Permissions: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to move files, create symlinks, and perform encryption.
